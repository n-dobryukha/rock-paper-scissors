Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game for two players. Each player simultaneously opens his/her hand to display a symbol:
    * Fist equals rock
    * Open hand equals paper
    * Showing the index and middle finger equals scissors.

The winner is determined by the following schema:
    * Rock beats (blunts) scissors
    * Paper beats (wraps) rock
    * Scissors beats (cuts) paper.
